# HEVC VPU Transform
#
# Transform matrix can be thought of as
#   output row vector = input row vector * transMatrix2
#
# The even rows of the matrix are symmetric
# The odd rows of the matrix are antisymmetric
#
# So only need to compute the first half of the results, then can compute the remainder with a butterfly
#
# EXAMPLE
#   (a b c d) (1 2  2  1)
#             (3 4 -4 -3)
#             (5 6  6  5)
#             (7 8 -8 -7)
#
#  x=(a c)(1 2) = 1a+5c 2a+6c
#         (5 6)
#
#  y=(b d)(3 4) = 3b+7d 4b+8d
#         (7 8)
#
#  u=x+y = 1a+5c+3b+7d 2a+4b+6c+8d
#  v=x-y = 1a+5c-3b-7d 2a+6c-4b-8d
#  
#  Final results are (u , v[::-1])
#
#
#  For 32x1 input, load even rows into HX(0++,0), odd rows into HX(16++,0)
#  Apply the even matrix first and stop before rounding
#  Then apply the odd matrix in a full manner:
#
#   First step is to compute partial products with the first input (16 cycles)        
#   1a 3b 5c 7d   16x1 input coefficients produce 16x16 output                      
#   2a 4b 6c 8d
#   2a -4b 6c -8d
#   1a -3b 5c -7d
#
#   Second step is to sum partial products into final position (8 cycles)
#   1a+3b+5c+7d
#   2a+4b+6c+8d
#   2a-4b+6c-8d
#   1a-3b+5c-7d
#
#   Then can apply butterfly to combine even results and odd results + rounding to produce 16 rows of output at a time (need to save in transposed format)
#
#   For 16x16 no butterfly is required and can store final results in original location  (Could do 2 16x16s in parallel to make use of the trick - saves on the adds)
#
#   For 8x8 we could compute two in parallel.
